# Rules
---

## Ruleset 1
- [ ] Sending Positive/Negative object(s) to Negative/Positive world
- [ ] Master Shifter only shifts the Player

## Ruleset 2
- [ ] Positive/Negative orb gives Positive/Negative functionality to one object
	- object example: Stairs change from stairs to flat angled surface
- [ ] Shifting causes Objects from one world to shift to the other. 
	- IE if in the negative world positive objects won't shift when you do.
- [ ] Can shoot both Positive and negative orbs
- [ ] You can only control one object at a time. 

## Ruleset 3
- Idk

%%- White/black projectile gives white/black functionality to object 
- they make a white/black object function as a black/white object, but only one of each at a time (shift cube excluded maybe) 
- horizontal and vertical rectangle movement manipulation 
- white enemies have white behavior, black enemies have black behavior. White world has white enemies, black world has black enemies. Shifting turns white enemies black vice versa. Player can shoot white orb at black enemies to have them turn into white enemy (same functionality as above note) 
- B feature: maybe opposite color orbs bounce off wall. Use grey walls for majority and introduce colored walls 
- What objects are in game? Each objects white/black functionality?%%
