## Working Memory
- Human RAM
	- Frees up with experience

### Posibilty Space
-When presented with a puzzle, an expert who is familiar with the mechanics might know there is only one posibility for making progress in the puzzle with those mechanics. Whereas a novice unfamiliar with the mechanics would imagine multiple posibilities.

## Puzzle Characteristics
- Handcrafted <------> Procedural
	- Ours is Handcrafted

### Noise
- Anything that occupies working memory but doesn't contribute to the puzzle
- Steals working memory from the player
- this can be something that doesn't contributr to the puzzle but is there to maybe distract the player from the solution
- not necessarily bad
	- can make a relatively simple puzzle artificially challenging
	- Useful if used intentionally
	- Can prevent accidental solving

1. ==**Simplify**==
	1. What do you want: Cleaner, Tighter puzzles
	2. How:
		1. Describe the solution
		2. Remove anything that you didn't mention
	3. Want Noise?
		1. Start with none. add it later
2. ==**Cut pointless levels**==
	1. For each level ask "What is the purpose?"
		1. no answer? remove it
	2. Possible Purposes for a level;
		1. Teaches something
		2. Reinforces a skill
		3. Has unique identifiable moments
		4. Palette Cleanser, or to break up the pacing
3. ==**You're the expert player**==
	1. if there are complaints listen to them
	2. Play through levels with your feet
4. ==**keep action and puzzles separate**==
5. ==**Make solution unambiguous**==
	1. red flags;
		1. Was that right?
		2. Oh. I solved it
		3. Players attempt impossible action
		4. trial and error = no fun
	2. Move elements farther apart
	3. Platformer? Make. All. Jumps. Obviously. Possible. Or. Impossible.
		1. Move platforms farther apart
6. ==**Player Trust**==
	1. Players assume no agility needed
	2. Break this rule once --> EVERY puzzle maybe requires reflexes
	3. Player perception is whats real
7. ==**Exhaustive Design vs. Fun**==
	1. **Fun** = Exhibiiting mastery, skill, or wit
	2. **Exhaustive Design** = one of every possible thing

## Tips
- Have **few mechanics** that yield **many puzzles**
